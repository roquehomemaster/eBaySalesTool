# PostgreSQL Container Issue in `eBaySalesTool`

## Problem Summary
The PostgreSQL container in the `eBaySalesTool` project fails to stabilize, remaining in a restarting or unhealthy state. This issue blocks the database initialization, migrations, and the overall build process, rendering the application non-functional.

---

## Symptoms
1. **Container State**:
   - The PostgreSQL container repeatedly restarts or remains unhealthy.
   - Health check (`pg_isready -U postgres`) fails consistently.

2. **Logs**:
   - Container logs are empty or indicate `Skipping initialization` due to an existing database directory.
   - No meaningful error messages are produced to diagnose the issue.

3. **Build Process**:
   - The `run_build.bat` script fails due to the unhealthy PostgreSQL container.
   - Attempts to reinitialize the database volume and rebuild the environment have not resolved the issue.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Standardized `POSTGRES_USER=postgres` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=securepassword` across all `docker-compose` files.

2. **Initialization Scripts**:
   - Reviewed SQL scripts in `database/migrations` for syntax errors and inconsistencies.
   - Temporarily disabled the `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` mount to isolate the issue.

3. **Volume Management**:
   - Removed and recreated the `ebaysalestool_db_data` volume multiple times to force reinitialization.

4. **Health Check**:
   - Verified the health check command (`pg_isready -U postgres`) and its configuration in `docker-compose.yml`.

5. **Manual Debugging**:
   - Started the PostgreSQL container interactively with minimal configuration to identify potential issues.

6. **Rebuild Attempts**:
   - Repeatedly ran the `run_build.bat` script after making changes to the environment, but the issue persisted.

---

## Observations
1. **Database Directory**:
   - The database directory appears to contain data, but the volume is empty when inspected.

2. **Initialization Scripts**:
   - No syntax errors were found in the reviewed SQL scripts, but their execution could not be verified due to the container's failure.

3. **Health Check**:
   - The health check fails because the database does not initialize properly.

4. **Logs**:
   - Container logs are empty or provide no actionable information.

## Next Steps for a Human Developer
1. **Deep Dive into Initialization**:
   - Manually apply the SQL scripts in `database/migrations` to identify any errors during execution.

2. **Inspect PostgreSQL Configuration**:
   - Verify the PostgreSQL version and configuration in the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.

3. **Debug Health Check**:
   - Modify or disable the health check temporarily to allow the container to stabilize.

4. **Enable Verbose Logging**:
   - Configure PostgreSQL to produce detailed logs during startup.

5. **Revisit Volume Permissions**:
   - Ensure the `ebaysalestool_db_data` volume has the correct permissions and is not corrupted.

6. **Collaborate with a Database Expert**:
   - Consult a PostgreSQL expert to identify potential misconfigurations or compatibility issues.

2. **Docker Compose Files**:
   - `docker-compose.yml`
   - `docker-compose.minimal.yml`
   - `backend/docker-compose.yml`

3. **Scripts**:
   - `backend/scripts/debug_database_setup.bat`
   - `backend/scripts/apply_migrations.js`

4. **Logs**:
   - `backend/logs/backend_container.log`
   - `logs/ownerships_resolution_log.txt`
