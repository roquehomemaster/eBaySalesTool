# Patch for docker-compose.yml to mount the correct seed directory into the backend container
# Add this under the backend: service volumes section:
#
#      - ./database/seeds:/usr/src/app/database/seeds:ro
#
# This ensures the backend container always has the latest seed file from your workspace.
# After applying, run:
#   docker compose down
#   docker compose up --build
# Then reseed the database from the backend context.
