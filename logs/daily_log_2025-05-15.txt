#### Backend Issue: `TypeError: sequelize.define is not a function`

1. **Initial Investigation**:
   - Verified that the `sequelize` instance works correctly in isolation using `testSequelize.js`.
   - Confirmed that the `postgres_db` container is running and healthy.

2. **Model Import Fixes**:
   - Fixed the import of `sequelize` in `ownershipModel.js` and `salesModel.js` to destructure it correctly from `database.js`.

3. **Backend Container Restarts**:
   - Restarted the backend container multiple times after fixing model imports to test if the issue was resolved.

4. **Standalone Test**:
   - Ran `testSequelize.js` to confirm that the `sequelize` instance works correctly in isolation.

5. **Database.js Inspection**:
   - Verified that `database.js` correctly initializes and exports the `sequelize` instance.

6. **Model File Inspections**:
   - Inspected `ownershipModel.js`, `salesModel.js`, and `itemModel.js` for correct usage of `sequelize`.

7. **Rebuild Backend Container**:
   - Attempted to rebuild the backend container to ensure dependencies were installed correctly.

### Analysis of Why the Issue Persists

1. **What Has Been Tried**:
   - Fixing imports in model files.
   - Verifying the `sequelize` instance in isolation.
   - Restarting and rebuilding the backend container.

2. **Why It Hasn't Worked**:
   - The `sequelize` instance works in isolation but fails in the backend container. This suggests:
     - A potential mismatch in the Sequelize version installed in the container.
     - An issue with how the backend application initializes or uses the `sequelize` instance.

3. **What Hasn't Been Considered**:
   - The possibility of an outdated or incorrect Sequelize package being installed in the backend container.
   - A deeper issue with the Docker environment or how the backend container is built.

### Next Steps

1. **Verify Sequelize Version in Backend Container**:
   - Check the installed Sequelize version in the backend container to ensure compatibility.

2. **Rebuild Backend Container**:
   - Rebuild the backend container from scratch to ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.

3. **Inspect Docker Environment**:
   - Review the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for potential misconfigurations.

4. **Simplify Debugging**:
   - Create a minimal test script inside the backend container to verify the `sequelize` instance directly.

### Immediate Plan

1. **Revisit Model Initialization**:
   - Double-check how models are defined and registered in the application.

2. **Test in Isolation**:
   - Run the application outside of Docker to confirm the issue is environment-specific.

3. **Resolve Environment Issues**:
   - Fix any misconfigurations in the Docker setup.

4. **Deliver Results**:
   - Ensure the application is operational and meets the requirements.
