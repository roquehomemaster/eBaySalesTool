# Daily Log - May 14, 2025

## Summary of Work

### Task Description:
Resolve issues in the `run_build.bat` script and associated files to ensure:
1. The build process completes successfully for backend, frontend, and Docker containers.
2. Correct environment variables and configurations are used, including `config.docker.use_compose` and `config.frontend.build`.
3. Resolve errors related to undefined properties in the `config` object during the build process.

### Key Actions Taken:

1. **Frontend Build Issue Resolved**:
   - Refactored the `buildFrontend` function in `build.js` to use `config.build.frontend` directly.
   - Verified that the frontend build completed successfully.

2. **Debugging and Logging**:
   - Added extensive logging to inspect the `config` object at various stages of the build process, including before calling `buildFrontend` and `startDockerContainers`.
   - Confirmed that the `config` object is correctly structured before being passed to functions.

3. **Backend Build**:
   - Verified that the backend build process completes successfully without errors.

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Logged and verified environment variables, including `POSTGRES_DB_IP`, `BACKEND_IP`, and `FRONTEND_IP`.

5. **Docker Configuration**:
   - Identified a new error related to `config.docker.use_compose` being `undefined` in the `startDockerContainers` function.

6. **Testing `startDockerContainers`**:
   - Created a test script (`test_startDockerContainers.js`) to isolate and test the `startDockerContainers` function with a mock `config` object.
   - Verified that the mock `config` object is correctly structured.

7. **Defensive Programming**:
   - Added defensive checks in `startDockerContainers` to log an error if `config.docker` is `undefined`.

### Current Status:
- The `config` object is correctly structured when logged before entering `startDockerContainers`.
- Inside `startDockerContainers`, `config.docker` becomes `undefined`, causing the error.
- The root cause of the issue has not yet been identified.

### Next Steps:
1. Trace the `config` object throughout the `startDockerContainers` function and its call stack to identify any overwrites or shadowing.
2. Simplify debugging by isolating the `startDockerContainers` function and testing it independently.
3. Implement a definitive fix for the issue.

### Observations:
- The issue appears to be related to scoping or mutation of the `config` object.
- Additional debugging and testing are required to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

### User Feedback:
- The user has expressed frustration with the lack of progress and repeated attempts to resolve the issue.
- A more focused and efficient approach is required to address the user's concerns and resolve the issue promptly.
