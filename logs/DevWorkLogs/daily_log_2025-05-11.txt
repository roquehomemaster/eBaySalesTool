## Actions Performed:

1. **Initialized Daily Log**:
   - Created a new log file to track today's activities and results.

2. **Database Issue Investigation**:
   - Starting with resolving the database connectivity issues to bring the backend container up.

3. **PostgreSQL Configuration Check**:
   - Verified `pg_hba.conf` allows connections from `192.168.0.0/24` with `trust` authentication.
   - Confirmed `postgresql.conf` has detailed logging enabled for diagnostics.

4. **Docker Network Inspection**:
   - Inspected the default Docker bridge network.
   - Subnet: `172.17.0.0/16`, Gateway: `172.17.0.1`.
   - No active containers are currently connected to the bridge network.

5. **Docker Compose Configuration Check**:
   - Verified `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Containers are configured to use the `192.168.0.0/24` subnet.
   - Database container is assigned `192.168.0.220`.
   - Backend container is assigned `192.168.0.221`.
   - Frontend container is assigned `192.168.0.222`.

6. **Restarted Docker Compose Services**:
   - Successfully restarted all services.
   - Backend, frontend, and database containers are now running.

7. **Database Health Check**:
   - Verified database container is healthy and accepting connections on port `5432`.

8. **Backend Container Logs**:
   - Observed repeated messages indicating the backend is unable to connect to the database at `192.168.0.220:5432`.
   - Backend is waiting for the database to become available.

9. **Backend Dockerfile Review**:
   - Verified that the `wait-for-it.sh` script is configured to wait for the database at `192.168.0.220:5432` before starting the backend.
   - No issues found in the Dockerfile configuration.

10. **Inspected wait-for-it.sh Script**:
    - Verified that the script uses `pg_isready` to check database availability.
    - The script appears to be correctly implemented.

11. **Database Connectivity Test from Backend Container**:
    - Attempted to connect to the database at `192.168.0.220:5432` using `pg_isready`.
    - Connection failed with no response.

12. **Docker Network Inspection**:
    - Verified that the backend container (`192.168.0.221`) and database container (`192.168.0.220`) are connected to the `listflowhq_default` network.
    - Both containers have valid IP addresses within the `192.168.0.0/24` subnet.

13. **Firewall Rule Check**:
    - Verified that inbound traffic to port `5432` for PostgreSQL is allowed by the host's firewall.
    - No issues found with the firewall configuration.

14. **Inspected Backend Database Connection Logic**:
    - Verified that the backend uses environment variables for database connection parameters.
    - Default values are set for `PG_HOST`, `PG_PORT`, `PG_USER`, `PG_PASSWORD`, and `PG_DATABASE`.
    - No issues found in the connection logic.

15. **Environment Variables Check**:
    - Verified the `PG_HOST` environment variable in the backend container is set to `postgres_db`.
    - This does not match the expected IP address `192.168.0.220`.

16. **Updated Backend Environment Variables**:
    - Modified `docker-compose.yml` to set `PG_HOST` to `192.168.0.220` for the backend service.

17. **Restarted Docker Compose Services**:
    - Successfully restarted all services.
    - Backend, frontend, and database containers are now running with updated environment variables.

18. **Database Connectivity Test from Backend Container (Post-Update)**:
    - Attempted to connect to the database at `192.168.0.220:5432` using `pg_isready`.

21. **Investigated Docker Networking**:
    - Verified Docker networking rules and ensured no host-level restrictions are blocking connectivity between containers.

22. **Verified PostgreSQL Listening Address**:
    - Confirmed `listen_addresses` is set to `192.168.0.220` in `postgresql.conf`.
    - PostgreSQL is configured to listen on the correct IP address.

23. **Inspected Backend Database Connection Logic**:
    - Verified that `database.js` uses environment variables for database connection parameters.
    - Connection parameters match the updated environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`.
    - No issues found in the connection logic.

24. **Tested Database Connectivity from Backend Container**:
    - Used `pg_isready` from the backend container to test connectivity to `192.168.0.220:5432`.
    - Connection failed with no response.

25. **Inspected Backend Container Logs**:
    - Attempted to retrieve logs from the backend container.
    - Encountered an error: "No such container: backend_container_name".
    - The container name might be incorrect or the container may not be running.

26. **Verified Running Containers**:
    - Found the database container running as `postgres_db`.
    - Found the backend container running as `listflowhq-backend-1` but marked as unhealthy.

27. **Inspected Backend Container Logs**:
    - Observed repeated messages indicating the backend was waiting for the database to become available.
    - Eventually, the database became available, and the backend successfully connected.
    - Backend logs show successful database connection and seeding process.
    - However, a synchronization error was logged: "No description found for \"items\" table. Check the table name and schema; remember, they _are_ case sensitive."

28. **Investigated Table Definition for "items"**:
    - Found the table definition in `init.sql`.
    - The table is created with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS items`.
    - The table name is lowercase, which may cause issues if the backend expects a case-sensitive match.

29. **Investigated Backend Expectations for "items" Table**:
    - Found references to `sequelize.models.Item` in `listingRoutes.js` and `itemRoutes.js`.
    - The backend expects the table name to be `Item` (case-sensitive).
    - This mismatch with the lowercase `items` table in the database may be causing the synchronization error.

30. **Updated init.sql for Case Sensitivity**:
    - Modified the `init.sql` file to rename the `items` table to `Item` to match the backend's case-sensitive expectations.

31. **Rebuilt Docker Environment**:
    - Rebuilt the Docker environment in detached mode to avoid blocking operations.
    - Used `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers.

## Actions Performed (Continued):

32. **Updated `sampleData.sql` for Case Sensitivity**:
    - Corrected the table name to `Item` in both `database/migrations/sampleData.sql` and `backend/sampleData.sql` to match the backend's expectations.

33. **Rebuilt Docker Environment**:
    - Rebuilt and restarted the Docker environment using `docker-compose up -d --build` to apply the changes made to the `sampleData.sql` files.

34. **Backend Container Health Check**:
    - Verified that the backend container is running without errors in the `database.js` file.

35. **Pending Verification**:
    - Verify the database schema and sample data initialization to ensure synchronization between the backend and the database.

36. **Cross-Verification of Database Schema and Backend Models**:
    - Verified `init.sql` and `sampleData.sql` for table definitions and field consistency.
    - Cross-checked Sequelize models (`itemModel.js`, `ownershipModel.js`, `salesModel.js`) with the SQL schema.
    - Ensured all fields, data types, and constraints match the documented requirements in `requirements.md`, `application_overview.md`, and `item_requirements.md`.
