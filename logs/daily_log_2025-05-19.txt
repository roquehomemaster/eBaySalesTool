### Daily Log - May 19, 2025

#### Task Summary:
1. Fix logging issues in the backend container to ensure logs are written to `backend_container.log`.
2. Resolve PostgreSQL connection issues (`ECONNREFUSED`) in the backend container.
3. Ensure the backend application runs correctly inside the Docker container.

---

#### Attempts and Findings:

1. **Initial Volume Mount Fix**:
   - Updated `docker-compose.yml` to map `backend/src` to `/usr/src/app`.
   - Restarted Docker Compose services.
   - Result: Backend container failed to start with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `app.js`.

2. **Adjusted Volume Mount Path**:
   - Changed volume mount to map `backend/src` to `/usr/src/app/src`.
   - Restarted Docker Compose services.
   - Result: Same error (`MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `app.js`).

3. **Simplified Volume Mount**:
   - Mapped `backend` directory to `/usr/src/app`.
   - Restarted Docker Compose services.
   - Result: Same error (`MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `app.js`).

4. **Corrected Working Directory**:
   - Verified `Dockerfile` and ensured `/usr/src/app` is set as the working directory.
   - Restarted Docker Compose services.
   - Result: Same error (`MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `app.js`).

5. **Inspected Directory Structure**:
   - Attempted to inspect the directory structure inside the container.
   - Result: Container not running, unable to inspect.

6. **Revised Volume Mount Again**:
   - Mapped `backend/src` directly to `/usr/src/app`.
   - Restarted Docker Compose services.
   - Result: Same error (`MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `app.js`).

7. **Verified PostgreSQL Connection**:
   - Attempted to run `testPostgresConnection.js` inside the container.
   - Result: Container not running, unable to test.

8. **Checked Container Logs**:
   - Reviewed logs for backend container.
   - Result: Consistent `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error for `app.js`.

---

#### Observations:
- The `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error persists despite multiple adjustments to the volume mount and working directory.
- The backend container is unable to locate `app.js` at `/usr/src/app/src/app.js`.
- PostgreSQL connection testing is blocked due to the container not running.

---

#### Next Steps:
1. Inspect the actual directory structure of the `backend/src` folder on the host system.
2. Ensure the `app.js` file is correctly located and accessible.
3. Verify the `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` configurations for consistency.
4. Restart the container and confirm the application starts successfully.

---

#### Accountability:
- Documented all attempts and findings.
- Identified repeated steps and consistent errors.
- Proposed a clear plan to resolve the issue.
