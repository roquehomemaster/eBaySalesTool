# Daily Log - May 9, 2025

## Actions Performed:

1. **Investigated Backend Connectivity Issue**:
   - Verified that the database is at `192.168.0.220`, the backend at `192.168.0.221`, and the frontend at `192.168.0.222`.
   - Updated the backend's `Dockerfile` to use the database's static IP (`192.168.0.220`) in the `wait-for-it.sh` script invocation.

2. **Rebuilt Docker Compose Services**:
   - Ran the build process using the updated batch script location.
   - Verified the build process logs and container statuses.

3. **Checked Docker Container Statuses**:
   - Frontend container exited with status `0`.
   - PostgreSQL container is running and healthy.
   - Backend container is running but marked as unhealthy.

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Inspect backend container logs to identify the issue.
   - Restart the frontend container if necessary.
